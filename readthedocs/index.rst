Welcome to DaNLP's documentation!
=================================


DaNLP is a repository for Natural Language Processing resources for the Danish Language. 
It is a collection  of available datasets and models for a variety of NLP tasks. 
The aim is to make it easier and more applicable to practitioners in the industry to use Danish NLP and hence this project is licensed to allow commercial use. The project features code examples on how to use the datasets and models in popular NLP frameworks such as spaCy, Transformers and Flair as well as Deep Learning frameworks such as PyTorch. 


If you are new to NLP or want to know more about the project in a broader perspective, you can have a look at our `microsite <https://danlp.alexandra.dk/>`_ (in Danish).
